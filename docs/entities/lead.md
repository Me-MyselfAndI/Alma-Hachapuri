# Lead

Intake submission — core entity. Holds form data, workflow state, assignment, and optional enrichment.

---

## Purpose

- Persist each prospect form submission
- Track state (7-state lifecycle — F2.1 confirmed)
- Link to prospect, resume, assigned account (attorney-role)

---

## Table: `leads`

| Column | Type | Required | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| `id` | UUID | PK | |
| `prospect_id` | UUID | FK → `prospects.id` | |
| `first_name` | VARCHAR(100) | yes | Denormalized from form at submit time |
| `last_name` | VARCHAR(100) | yes | |
| `email` | VARCHAR(255) | yes | Denormalized — snapshot at submit |
| `resume_file_id` | UUID | FK → `resume_files.id` | |
| `state` | VARCHAR(50) | yes | Default `PENDING`. See lifecycle below |
| `state_changed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | yes | Set on create and on every state change; powers "how long waiting / going cold" (replaces the old `IN_CONTACT`/`ON_HOLD` states) |
| `source` | VARCHAR(100) | no | Optional attribution (A7) |
| `custom_fields` | JSONB | no | LLM-extracted; null until enriched (F7.1) |
| `assigned_account_id` | UUID | FK → `accounts.id` | Set on create (F6.1); assignee must have assignable role |
| `archived_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | no | Set by L14; null = active |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | yes | |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | yes | |

---

## State lifecycle (confirmed — F2.1, simplified 2026-06-27)

The lifecycle is a **whose-turn-is-it ping-pong** plus a fit decision. The old `IN_CONTACT` / `ON_HOLD` states were removed: they only differed by *how long* a lead had been waiting, which is now derived from `state_changed_at` (no separate status needed).

| State | Meaning (whose turn) | What triggers leaving it |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `PENDING` | **Our turn** — new submission *or* the prospect just replied; we owe the next action (**brief**) | Staff contacts/responds → `REACHED_OUT`; or staff judges fit |
| `REACHED_OUT` | **Their turn** — we contacted/responded; awaiting the prospect (**brief**) | Prospect replies → back to `PENDING`; or staff judges fit |
| `QUALIFIED` | Staff decided **good fit**; moving toward engagement | Engagement concluded → `CLOSED` |
| `DISQUALIFIED` | Staff decided **not a fit** / declined / out of scope / went cold | Closed out → `CLOSED` |
| `CLOSED` | Terminal — resolved either way (won, lost, abandoned) | — |

**Key ideas:**
- `PENDING` ⇄ `REACHED_OUT` flips every time the ball changes court. A prospect reply moves it **back to `PENDING`** (our turn again).
- **"How long have we waited / is this going cold?"** = `now − state_changed_at` — a timestamp, not a status. A long stay in `REACHED_OUT` is what used to be "on hold."
- **Qualify / disqualify is a human staff decision**, made at any point it is the lead's turn — not an automatic rule.

**Transition rules (v1):**

```text
PENDING → REACHED_OUT | QUALIFIED | DISQUALIFIED
REACHED_OUT → PENDING | QUALIFIED | DISQUALIFIED
QUALIFIED → CLOSED
DISQUALIFIED → CLOSED
CLOSED → (terminal)
```

Invalid transition → 400. Every change appends to `lead_state_history` and updates `state_changed_at`.

---

## Relationships

| Relation | Target | Cardinality |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `prospect` | Prospect | N leads → 1 prospect |
| `resume_file` | Resume file | 1 lead → 1 file (v1) |
| `assigned_account` | Account | N leads → 1 account (assignee) |
| `state_history` | Lead state history | 1 lead → N history rows |
| `email_notifications` | Email notification | 1 lead → N emails |

---

## Business rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Public intake (two-step) | **RequestLeadVerification** stores pending intake + temp resume and sends verification email — **no lead row yet**. **VerifyEmailAndCreateLead** (token from email link) runs full create orchestration. |
| Email normalization (D7) | Lowercase + trim on every write (`RequestLeadVerification`, prospect find-or-create, lead denormalized `email`) |
| State update | Internal only; attorney/admin per F6.2 |
| On verify + create (L1b) | Find-or-create prospect; promote resume; auto-assign account; send emails (S7); optionally queue LLM job |
| Denormalized names/email | Snapshot at verify time — prospect update does not retro-edit old leads |
| Read scope (D1) | Attorneys with `read_leads` see **all** leads/resumes in list and detail — not limited to assigned rows |
| Archived access (D3) | Archived leads remain readable by id (GetLead, DownloadResume, sub-routes); excluded from ListLeads unless `include_archived=true` |

---

## Pending intake (pre-lead)

Until email is verified, form data lives outside `leads`.

### Table: `lead_intake_pending` *(proposed name — confirm at implementation)*

| Column | Type | Required | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| `id` | UUID | PK | |
| `token_hash` | VARCHAR(255) | yes | Hash of single-use verification token (never store raw token) |
| `email` | VARCHAR(255) | yes | Lowercase normalized (D7) |
| `first_name` | VARCHAR(100) | yes | |
| `last_name` | VARCHAR(100) | yes | |
| `source` | VARCHAR(100) | no | Optional attribution (A7) |
| `temp_resume_path` | VARCHAR(500) | yes | Pending file location until L1b promotes |
| `temp_resume_original_filename` | VARCHAR(255) | yes | |
| `temp_resume_mime_type` | VARCHAR(100) | yes | |
| `temp_resume_size_bytes` | BIGINT | yes | |
| `expires_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | yes | Token TTL — **TBD** (see open questions; e.g. 24–72 h) |
| `used_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | no | Set when L1b succeeds; prevents replay |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | yes | |

**Cleanup:** Orphan pending rows + temp files after expiry (background job — out of scope v1 unless trivial).

---

## API touchpoints

| Operation | Endpoint | Auth | Action |
|-----------|----------|------|--------|
| RequestLeadVerification | `POST /leads/verification-requests` | Public | Store pending intake; send verification email |
| VerifyEmailAndCreateLead | `GET /leads/verify?token=` (link) · `POST /leads/verify` (SPA) | Public | Consume token; create lead (+ prospect, file, emails) |
| ListLeads | `GET /leads` | Internal | List with filters (state, assignee) |
| GetLead | `GET /leads/{id}` | Internal | Detail incl. prospect, resume URL, custom_fields |
| UpdateLead | `PATCH /leads/{id}` | Internal | Update state, assignment |

---

## Pydantic schemas (proposed)

| Schema | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `LeadVerificationRequestForm` | Public multipart — RequestLeadVerification |
| `LeadVerificationRequestResponse` | 202 / check-your-email payload |
| `LeadVerifyRequest` | POST body with `token` (SPA path) |
| `LeadCreateResponse` | Public success after VerifyEmailAndCreateLead |
| `LeadRead` | API response |
| `LeadUpdate` | Internal PATCH (state, assigned_account_id) |
| `LeadListItem` | Dashboard row |

---

## Preconditions

Guardrails that must hold **before** each operation succeeds. Permission checks (`read_leads`, `write_lead`, etc.) are separate — see [permission.md](permission.md). Readable operation names match [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) Flow A/B.

| Operation | Route ID | Must hold |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **RequestLeadVerification** | L1a | No auth. Valid multipart: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `resume` (PDF/DOC/DOCX, ≤10 MB). Email normalized lowercase (D7). Resume saved to temp storage. Pending row + token created. Verification email send **must succeed** — otherwise rollback pending + temp file; **no lead row**. |
| **VerifyEmailAndCreateLead** | L1b | No auth. Token present and matches pending row. Token **not expired** and **not already used**. Pending intake + temp resume exist. On success: single transaction for prospect (S1), resume promote (S2), assignee (S3), lead insert, history (S6), then S7 emails + optional S8. Mark token `used_at`. |
| **ListLeads** | L2 | Valid JWT. Caller has `read_leads`. **D1:** attorneys see **all** leads — no assignee filter unless caller passes `assigned_account_id` or `mine=true`. Active leads only unless `include_archived=true`. |
| **GetLead** | L3 | Valid JWT. `read_leads`. Lead exists. **D3:** `archived_at` set does **not** block access — 404 only when id missing. **D1:** any attorney may read any lead. |
| **UpdateLead** | L4 | Valid JWT. `write_lead` (write scope still assigned-lead for attorneys per F6.2). Lead exists. Valid transition if `state` changes. `assign_lead` if reassigning. **D3:** archived leads remain addressable by id. |
| **DownloadResume** | L5 | Valid JWT. `read_leads`. Lead + resume exist. **D3:** allowed for archived leads. **D1:** attorneys may download any lead's resume. Spec: [resume-file.md](resume-file.md). |
| **ListLeadEmails** | L6 | Valid JWT. `read_emails`. Lead exists. **D3:** archived OK. Spec: [email-notification.md](email-notification.md). |
| **GetLeadStateHistory** | L7 | Valid JWT. `read_leads`. Lead exists. **D3:** archived OK. Spec: [lead-state-history.md](lead-state-history.md). |
| **TransitionLead** | L10 | Valid JWT. `write_lead`. Lead exists. `to_state` allowed by transition matrix. **D3:** archived leads still transition-capable (or document if blocked — v1: allow). |
| **ExportLeads** | L13 | Valid JWT. `export_leads`. Same filter semantics as ListLeads (D1, `include_archived`). |
| **ArchiveLead** | L14 | Valid JWT. `write_lead`. Lead exists and not already archived (re-archive → idempotent 204 or 404 — pick at implement). Sets `archived_at`. |

**Prospect routes (D9 — in v1):** [prospect.md](prospect.md) P1/P2 require `read_prospect`; lead existence for nested lists follows same D3 rules.

Implementation helpers: `api/src/domains/lead/preconditions.py` (tested by `api/tst/domains/lead/test_lead_preconditions.py`).

> **Naming:** **L6/L7** = HTTP routes (sub-entities). **S6/S7** in orchestration = service calls on verify+create — different IDs.

### HTTP

#### L1a · **RequestLeadVerification** · `POST /api/v1/leads/verification-requests`

**Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

| Part | Type | Required |
|------|------|----------|
| `first_name` | string | yes |
| `last_name` | string | yes |
| `email` | string (email) | yes — stored lowercase (D7) |
| `source` | string | no |
| `resume` | file (PDF/DOC/DOCX, ≤10 MB) | yes |

**Response `202` — `LeadVerificationRequestResponse`:**

```json
{
  "message": "Check your email to confirm your submission.",
  "email": "jane@example.com"
}
```

`email` echoes normalized address (for UI display only).

**Errors:** 400 (file type/size); 422 (validation); 502/503 if verification email cannot be sent (pending row rolled back).

**Side effects:** Insert `lead_intake_pending`; save resume to **temp** storage; send verification email with link `{WEBAPP_URL}/verify?token={token}` (exact URL TBD). **No** prospect row, **no** lead row, **no** S7.

See [API_CATALOG.md](API_CATALOG.md#orchestration-lead-intake-l1a--l1b).

---

#### L1b · **VerifyEmailAndCreateLead** · `GET /api/v1/leads/verify` · `POST /api/v1/leads/verify`

**GET** — email link (browser): `?token={opaque_token}`

**POST** — SPA / JSON clients:

```json
{ "token": "opaque-token-from-email" }
```

**Response `201` — `LeadCreateResponse`:**

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "state": "PENDING",
  "message": "Thank you for your submission."
}
```

**Errors:** 400 (`token` missing); 404 (unknown token); 410 (expired token); 409 (token already used); 422 (pending data invalid).

**Side effects:** Load pending by token; reject expired/used; run create orchestration (S1–S7, optional S8); mark pending `used_at`; promote temp resume. See [API_CATALOG.md](API_CATALOG.md#orchestration-lead-intake-l1a--l1b).

---

#### L2 · **ListLeads** · `GET /api/v1/leads` — List leads (internal)

**Permission:** `read_leads`

**Scope (D1):** Attorneys and other roles with `read_leads` receive **all** active leads — not restricted to `assigned_account_id = self`. Use `?mine=true` or `?assigned_account_id=` to narrow intentionally.

**Query — `LeadListParams`:**

| Param | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `state` | lead state enum | — |
| `assigned_account_id` | UUID | — |
| `mine` | bool | false — if true, filter to `assigned_account_id` = current JWT account (convenience; same as passing your own id) |
| `include_archived` | bool | false |
| `page` | int | 1 |
| `page_size` | int | 20 |

**L8 not added:** `GET /leads/mine` would duplicate L2 — use `?mine=true` or `?assigned_account_id={your_id}`.

**Response `200` — `Paginated[LeadListItem]`:**

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "state": "PENDING",
      "source": null,
      "assigned_account_id": "uuid",
      "assigned_account_name": "John Smith",
      "created_at": "2026-06-27T21:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 42,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 20
}
```

---

#### L3 · **GetLead** · `GET /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}` — Lead detail (internal)

**Permission:** `read_leads`

**Archived (D3):** Returns `200` even when `archived_at` is set. Only unknown `lead_id` → 404.

**Response `200` — `LeadRead`:**

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "prospect_id": "uuid",
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "state": "PENDING",
  "source": null,
  "custom_fields": null,
  "assigned_account_id": "uuid",
  "assigned_account": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "work_email": "john@firm.com"
  },
  "resume": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "original_filename": "cv.pdf",
    "mime_type": "application/pdf",
    "size_bytes": 12345,
    "download_url": "/api/v1/leads/{lead_id}/resume"
  },
  "prospect": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  },
  "created_at": "2026-06-27T21:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-06-27T21:00:00Z"
}
```

`custom_fields` populated asynchronously when F7.1 runs.

---

#### L4 · `PATCH /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}` — Update lead (internal)

**Permission:** `write_lead`; `assign_lead` required if `assigned_account_id` present.

**Body — `LeadUpdate` (all optional, ≥1 field):**

```json
{
  "state": "REACHED_OUT",
  "assigned_account_id": "uuid"
}
```

**Response `200` — `LeadRead`**

**Validation:** State transition rules — see lifecycle above. Invalid → 400.

**Side effects:** S6 `record_transition` when `state` changes.

**Note:** Prefer **L10** for state-only changes (optional transition note). Use L4 for assignment and other field updates.

---

#### L5 · `GET /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}/resume` — Download resume

**Full spec:** [resume-file.md](resume-file.md#L5). Permission: `read_leads`. Streams CV binary.

---

#### L6 · `GET /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}/emails` — List emails for this lead

**Full spec:** [email-notification.md](email-notification.md#L6). Permission: `read_emails`.

Returns all `email_notifications` for the lead (auto S7 sends + staff E2 sends). Optional `?conversation_id=` filter.

---

#### L7 · `GET /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}/state-history` — State change audit

**Full spec:** [lead-state-history.md](lead-state-history.md#L7). Permission: `read_leads`.

Returns append-only history: who changed state, when, from → to, optional `note` (from L10).

---

#### L10 · `POST /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}/transitions` — State transition

**Permission:** `write_lead`

**Body — `LeadTransitionRequest`:**

```json
{
  "to_state": "REACHED_OUT",
  "note": "Left voicemail, emailed follow-up"
}
```

`note` optional — stored on `lead_state_history.note` (not a separate lead notes field).

**Response `200` — `LeadRead`**

**Validation:** Transition matrix in lifecycle section. Invalid → 400.

**Side effects:** S6 `record_transition` with optional note.

---

#### L13 · `GET /api/v1/leads/export` — CSV export

**Permission:** `export_leads`

**Query:** Same filters as L2 (`state`, `assigned_account_id`, `mine`, `include_archived`).

**Response `200`:** `text/csv` stream; `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="leads.csv"`.

Columns: id, names, email, state, source, assignee, created_at (minimum).

---

#### L14 · **ArchiveLead** · `DELETE /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}` — Archive lead

**Permission:** `write_lead` (admin may always; attorney scoped to assigned)

**Response `204`** No content.

**Behavior:** Soft-delete — set `archived_at=now()`. Excluded from L2 unless `include_archived=true`. **D3:** direct GET/L5/L6/L7 remain allowed after archive. Not purged from DB.

---

### Service — `EnrichmentService` (F7.1, optional)

```python
# api/src/services/enrichment.py

def enqueue_lead_enrichment(lead_id: UUID) -> None:
    """FastAPI BackgroundTasks or asyncio task.
    Reads resume text; calls LLM; PATCHes lead.custom_fields.
    Failures logged only — never block L1b."""

def extract_custom_fields(resume_bytes: bytes, mime_type: str) -> dict:
    """Returns JSON-serializable custom_fields dict."""
```

**Called by:** L1b when `settings.enable_llm_enrichment=true` — **S8**.

---

### Service — `LeadService`

```python
# api/src/domains/lead/service.py

def request_verification(
    db: Session,
    *,
    first_name: str,
    last_name: str,
    email: str,

## Deferred / out of scope

| ID | Action | Decision |
|----|--------|----------|
| **L8** | `GET /leads/mine` | **Rejected** — redundant with L2 `?mine=true` or `?assigned_account_id=` |
| **L9** | `GET /leads/stats` | **Out of scope** v1 |
| **L11** | `GET /leads/{id}/timeline` | **Pending** — unified feed (see below) |
| **L12** | `PATCH /leads/{id}/notes` | **Pending** — no `internal_notes` column today (see below) |

### What is L11?

Single endpoint returning a **merged activity feed** for one lead, sorted by time:

| Event type | Source |
|------------|--------|
| State change | `lead_state_history` |
| Email sent/failed | `email_notifications` |
| Enrichment completed | `leads.custom_fields` updated (F7.1) |

Alternative v1: client calls L7 + L6 separately — L11 is UI sugar only. Approve if you want one round-trip for detail page.

### Internal notes (L12)

**Not tracked today.** We have:

| Mechanism | What it stores |
|-----------|----------------|
| **L10 `note`** | Optional comment on a **state transition** → `lead_state_history.note` |
| **L12 `internal_notes`** | Would be a freeform scratchpad on the **lead row** (always visible on detail) — **not in schema yet** |

If you want a persistent lead-level notepad (not tied to a transition), say yes and we add `internal_notes TEXT` + L12.

**Approved:** L10, L13, L14.
